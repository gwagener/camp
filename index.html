              We're back in Wellington for 2016 at the fantastic YMCA Camp Kaitoke.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tickets are NZ$300 (or NZ$200 for students or unwaged). They include accommodation, 3 meals a day &amp; snacks for the duration of the camp and a bus there and back from Wellington Central Train Station.
            </p>

            <p>
              We're still organising the buses. They will be leaving the Wellington Central Rail Station by 2pm at the very earliest. If you're from out of town you'll you’d need to land/arrive, get through customs (if applicable) and into town before then.
            </p>
            <p>
              As there will be two buses we’re seriously considering staggered leaving times, especially as trying to fly in on the same day may be a bit hard for some people. The second one could be anywhere from 3pm to 4pm. None of that has been finalised yet. If you end up arriving on the previous day do let us know, we'll try and find a hot desk for you to use if you need one. And we can could organise a group dinner on the Thursday night :-)
            </p>
            <p>
              We will get you back into Wellington by 12pm on the Monday at the latest.
            </p>

            <h3>The Code</h3>

            <p>
              Rails Camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free camp experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>We do not tolerate harassment of Rails Camp participants in any form.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Harassment includes but is not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion.</li>
              <li>sexual imagery.</li>
              <li>deliberate intimidation.</li>
              <li>stalking.</li>
              <li>unwanted following.</li>
              <li>harassing photography or recording.</li>
              <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
              <li>inappropriate physical contact.</li>
              <li>unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate anywhere within the camp venue, including during talks or in supporting materials such as slides or handouts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images or material, either in person or in handouts or other collateral. Sponsor staff and representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing or costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                If camp participants violate these rules, including engaging in harassing behaviour, the camp organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the camp with no refund. This may include a temporary or permanent ban from future Rails Camp events.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising committee immediately.  A camp organising team member can be identified by their red Rails Camp t-shirt.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rails Camp will be happy to provide escorts, help participants contact police, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the camp.
            </p>

            <p>
              We expect participants to follow these rules at all camp venues, on the journey to and from the camp and at any related social activities.
            </p>
